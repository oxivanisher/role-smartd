# defaults file for smartd

# this is to battle this three year old bug which seems to be ignored:
# https://www.smartmontools.org/ticket/1222
# basically, some versions of smartmontools will report daily errors
# on nvme drives, even if there are no errors. -.-
# disabling devicescan requires you to configure the drives manually in
# /etc/smartd.conf
smartd_disable_devicescan: false
